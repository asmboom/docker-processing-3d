Docker processing 3d

# Create a release processing3d images

```
        bash scripts/build_release.sh
```


# Developer workflow

The main issue is compile time with osg, so to make it faster and not rebuild osg each time.
There are two images used in the developer workflow. The processing3d-system used to 'cache' the deps needed by the processing tools and the processing3d images based on the processing3d-system.

```
        bash scripts/build_dev.sh
```
It builds the base to compile osg and install other tools. To build osg from your host directory use the script. Change the variable OSG_SOURCE_PATH

```
        bash scripts/build_dev_osg.sh
```


# Workflow to convert models

To convert models when your docker images is done, it can be release or dev.
```
        docker run --rm -v YOUR_HOST_DIRECTORY:/data -t sketchfab/processing3d:latest osgconv /data/model.obj /data/result.osg
```
